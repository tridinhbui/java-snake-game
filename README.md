# Snake Game

Snake Game is everyone's childhood game. Due to our familiarity with this game, we would love to recreate the game as the final project for this class. 

The main functionality of the game is to guide the snake to eat the food on the game board, resulting in the snake getting longer gradually. The game will end when the snake hits the wall or gets too long to the point that its head collides with its body. 

More advanced functionality that we would love to include are: 1. increase the speed of the snake as the snake gets longer, 2. increase the amount of food on the game board, 3. add the music, and so on. 

We have done some research on the internet, and have been inspired by various sources available on the Internet:
